Package: atm-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Base programs for ATM in Linux, the net-tools for ATM
 This package provides all the basic programs needed for setting up,
 monitoring and tuning ATM networks. Such as:
  * atmsigd, an ATM signal daemon that implements the ATM UNI protocol.
  * atmtcp, a tool to setup ATM over TCP connections.
  * atmarpd, an implementation of the ATMARP protocol (RFC1577, RFC1755)
  * zeppelin, an ATM LAN Emulation client daemon
  * les and bus, ATM LAN Emulation service daemons
 .
 Notice that upstream still flags these tools as experimental software and
 says that there is still a number of known bugs and issues. The
 software is, however, in productive use at a number of sites and is
  working reliably.

Package: atm-tools-br2684
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: br2864ctl - RFC1483/2864 Bridge Daemon for ATM Networks
 br2684ctl handles RFC1483/2684 bridged PDUs. This is most often
 used  in  ADSL scenarios where usually the subscribers' ethernet
 traffic is encapsulated in ATM AAL5 (by  bridging  ADSL  modems)
 according to RFC2684
 .
 The sources for br2684ctl has been pulled from linux-atm's CVS
 repository. Warning: This is unreleased software that can break any
 time, any place. If it does, you get to keep the pieces. linux-atm's
 upstream flags even the released software as experimental software.
 There is still a number of known bugs and issues.
