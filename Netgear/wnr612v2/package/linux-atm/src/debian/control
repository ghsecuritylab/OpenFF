Description: Base programs for ATM in Linux, the net-tools for ATM
 This package provides all the basic programs needed for setting up,
 monitoring and tuning ATM networks. Such as:
  * atmsigd, an ATM signal daemon that implements the ATM UNI protocol.
  * atmtcp, a tool to setup ATM over TCP connections.
  * atmarpd, an implementation of the ATMARP protocol (RFC1577, RFC1755)
  * zeppelin, an ATM LAN Emulation client daemon
  * les and bus, ATM LAN Emulation service daemons
 .
 Notice that upstream still flags these tools as experimental software and
 says that there is still a number of known bugs and issues. The
 software is, however, in productive use at a number of sites and is
  working reliably.
