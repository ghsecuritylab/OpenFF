Description: pppol2tp-kmod modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_).
 This package contains the compiled pppol2tp kernel module for _KVERS_
 which provides a PPP-over-L2TP socket for use by L2TP daemons.
 The driver handles is integrated with the Linux kernel networking
 subsystem such that PPP data frames carried over L2TP are handled
 entirely by the kernel.
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own pppol2tp-kmod-modules. The pppol2tp-kmod-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of pppol2tp-kmod-modules for your kernel.
