Notes on configuring the Debian package of dnsmasq.

(1) To configure dnsmasq edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf. See man 8 dnsmasq for
    details of the options. /etc/default/dnsmasq also exists but 
    shouldn't need to be touched in most cases.
 
(2) The Debian dhcpcd package provides /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf which is
    a suitable file for dnsmasq to read its upstream nameservers
    from. You probably want to have just 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf
    and to have dhcpcd not update that, which is the default.
